We received funding from the Helmholtz Association's Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Unit ([Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/){target="_blank"}) for our project Machine-learning based synthetic data generation for rapid physics modeling (SynRap). In collaboration with the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg), we will investigate whether data on the behavior of physical systems can be generated more quickly using neural networks in the form of so-called synthetic data. Our project was selected for funding through a competitive process. The fifteen winning teams will receive a total of 6.2 million euros over the next few years to carry out their projects.
