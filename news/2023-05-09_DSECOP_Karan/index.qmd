Congratulations, Karan, for being accepted into the program for the second time! 

Given the growing demand for data science skills, many physics programs are beginning to incorporate data science into their curriculums. A team of physicists led by the [Topical Group on Data Science (GDS)](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201910/gds.cfm){target="_blank"} and funded by the [American Physical Society (APS)](https://www.aps.org/){target="_blank"} is therefore developing teaching modules for data science that can be easily integrated into undergraduate physics courses. The project, known as the [Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP)](https://dsecop.org/){target="_blank"}, was designed to bridge the gap between traditional physics education and the skills physicists need in industry.
