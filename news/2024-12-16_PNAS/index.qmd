How does the Earth generate its magnetic field? While the basic mechanisms seem to be understood, many details remain unresolved. Together with our collaborators from Sandia National Laboratories and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), we have introduced a simulation method that promises new insights into the Earth’s core. The method simulates not only the behavior of atoms, but also the magnetic properties of materials. The approach is significant for geophysics, but could also support the development of future technologies such as neuromorphic computing — an innovative approach to more efficient AI systems. We published this work [PNAS](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2408897121){target="_blank"}.
