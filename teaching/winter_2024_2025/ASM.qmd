I contributed to the course [Atomistic Simulation Methods](https://wwwdek.inf.tu-dresden.de/mole-web/catalogs/wise2425/modules/cms-ce-el1/courses){target="_blank"} offered by the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik){target="_blank"} at [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/){target="_blank"} (TU Dresden).

My contributions included delivering two lectures on machine learning interatomic potentials. The Lecture slides are provided below.

### Lectures
