Our lab leverages machine learning and high-performance computing simulations to accelerate the discovery of new materials. We are particularly focused on the following key research thrusts:

## Machine Learning and Electronic Structure Methods

We develop the **Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA)**, a physics-informed machine learning framework that aims to accelerate conventional density functional theory simulations. Using neural networks, MALA efficiently computes the electronic structure of matter, enabling accurate determination of energies and forces that are critical for atomistic simulations. MALA is a scalable method that balances accuracy and speed, overcoming the limitations of conventional density functional theory simulations. It combines the scalability of atomistic simulations with the high accuracy of first-principles methods, paving the way for electronic structure calculations at unprecedented length and time scales. This advancement in materials modeling opens up a broad range of potential applications.

## Atomistic Molecular Spin Dynamics

By combining first-principles data generation with machine learning models, we create interatomic potentials for high-performance molecular-spin dynamics simulations. This methodology allows us to simulate the dynamics of ions and of electronic spins simultaneously. We utilize this method for tackling a wide range of applications, including the analysis of material strength, the investigation of transport properties in nanoscale systems, and the simulation of magneto-structural phase transitions relevant for developing ultrafast magnetic storage devices.

## Explorative Artificial Intelligence for Materials Modeling

We apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to advance first-principles simulations and accelerate materials discovery. 
For example:
We use physics-informed neural networks and other autoregressive models to simulate how electrons in materials respond to optical laser light.
We apply neural operators to develop machine learning representations of electron-electron interactions, specifically targeting the exchange-correlation energy.
We leverage generative and reinforcement learning techniques to design models that drive autonomous materials discovery.

*   **Key Areas:** Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory, Exchange-Correlation Functional, AI for Materials Discovery
