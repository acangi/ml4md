Our lab leverages machine learning and high-performance computing simulations to accelerate the discovery and understanding of new materials. We focus on the following key research thrusts:


## Machine Learning and Electronic Structure Methods

We develop the **Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA)**, a physics-informed machine learning framework designed to accelerate conventional density functional theory simulations. MALA employs neural network architectures to accurately predict electronic structures across different parameter spaces. Our scalable approach overcomes the limitations of conventional density functional theory simulations, paving the way for electronic structure calculations at unprecedented length and time scales.

## Atomistic Molecular Spin Dynamics

We combine first-principles calculations with machine learning models to generate accurate interatomic potentials for high-performance molecular-spin dynamics simulations. Our computational framework allow simultaneous simulations of ionic and spin dynamics, enabling detailed analyses of structural stability, transport phenomena, and magneto-structural phase transitions. This approach holds promise for developing next-generation magnetic materials and ultrafast magnetic storage technologies.
