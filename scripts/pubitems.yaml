  description: The electronic structure in matter under extreme conditions is a challenging
    complex system prevalent in astrophysical objects and highly relevant for technological
    applications. We show how machine-learning surrogates in terms of neural networks
    have a profound impact on the efficient modeling of matter under extreme conditions.
    We demonstrate the utility of a surrogate model that is trained on \emph{ab initio}
    quantum Monte Carlo data for various applications in the emerging field of warm
    dense matter research.

  description: Computational tools to study thermodynamic properties of magnetic materials
    have, until recently, been limited to phenomenological modeling or to small domain
    sizes limiting our mechanistic understanding of thermal transport in ferromagnets.
    Herein, we study the interplay of phonon and magnetic spin contributions to the
    thermal conductivity in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha{\$}{\$}-iron utilizing non-equilibrium
    molecular dynamics simulations. It was observed that the magnetic spin contribution
    to the total thermal conductivity exceeds lattice transport for temperatures up
    to two-thirds of the Curie temperature after which only strongly coupled magnon-phonon
    modes become active heat carriers. Characterizations of the phonon and magnon
    spectra give a detailed insight into the coupling between these heat carriers,
    and the temperature sensitivity of these coupled systems. Comparisons to both
    experiments and ab initio data support our inferred electronic thermal conductivity,
    supporting the coupled molecular dynamics/spin dynamics framework as a viable
    method to extend the predictive capability for magnetic material properties.

  description: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification
    systems are often susceptible to noise interruption, i.e., minor image noise may
    significantly impact the outcome. On the contrary, classical Spiking Neural Network
    (SNN) is known for handling noisy data due to the stochastic and temporal behaviour
    of the spiking neuron signals. However, it is not always feasible to train the
    weights of the classical SNN due to stochastic and non-differentiable spiking
    signals. Recent applications of quantum machine learning to stochastic modelling
    have predicted that quantum computing would prove to be a significant advantage,
    hence catapulting the study of quantum and neuromorphic computing to a new level
    of development. Motivated by these observations, this paper introduces a shallow
    hybrid classical--quantum spiking feedforward neural network referred to as Spiking
    Quantum Neural Network (SQNN) for dealing with a robust image classification task
    in the presence of noise and adversarial attacks. The proposed SQNN offers the
    inherent capabilities of processing unforeseen noisy test images due to its spatial
    and temporal information. An efficient variational quantum circuit training with
    the help of a standard back-propagation algorithm obviates the classical Spiking
    Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike-Prop algorithms, which are often found
    inefficient in training the feedforward SNN. The proposed SQNN is extensively
    tested and benchmarked on the PennyLane Quantum Simulator. Experimental results
    show that the proposed SQNN model supersedes the feedforward SNN (SFNN), Random
    Quantum Neural Networks (RQNN), AlexNet and ResNet-18 on unseen test images with
    added noise from the FashionMNIST, MNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.

  description: We present a comprehensive investigation of the electrical and thermal
    conductivity of iron under high pressures at ambient temperature, employing the
    real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT).
    Specifically, we examine the influence of a Hubbard correction (+U) to account
    for strong electron correlations. Our calculations based on RT-TDDFT demonstrate
    that the evaluated electrical conductivity for both high-pressure body-centered
    cubic (BCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) iron phases agrees well with experimental
    data. Furthermore, we explore the anisotropy in the thermal conductivity of HCP
    iron under high pressure, and our findings are consistent with experimental observations.
    Interestingly, we find that the incorporation of the +U correction significantly
    impacts the ground state and linear response properties of iron at pressures below
    50 GPa, with its influence diminishing as pressure increases. This study offers
    valuable insights into the influence of electronic correlations on the electronic
    transport properties of iron under extreme conditions.

  description: Rapid access to accurate equation-of-state (EOS) data is crucial in
    the warm-dense matter (WDM) regime, as it is employed in various applications,
    such as providing input for hydrodynamic codes to model inertial confinement fusion
    processes. In this study, we develop neural network models for predicting the
    EOS based on first-principles data. The first model utilises basic physical properties,
    while the second model incorporates more sophisticated physical information, using
    output from average-atom (AA) calculations as features. AA models are often noted
    for providing a reasonable balance of accuracy and speed; however, our comparison
    of AA models and higher-fidelity calculations shows that more accurate models
    are required in the WDM regime. Both the neural network models we propose, particularly
    the physics-enhanced one, demonstrate significant potential as accurate and efficient
    methods for computing EOS data in WDM.

  description: Electronic structure theory calculations offer an understanding of
    matter at the quantum level, complementing experimental studies in materials science
    and chemistry. One of the most widely used methods, density functional theory,
    maps a set of real interacting electrons to a set of fictitious non-interacting
    electrons that share the same probability density. Ensuring that the density remains
    the same depends on the exchange-correlation (XC) energy and, by a derivative,
    the XC potential. Inversions provide a method to obtain exact XC potentials from
    target electronic densities, in hopes of gaining insights into accuracy-boosting
    approximations. Neural networks provide a new avenue to perform inversions by
    learning the mapping from density to potential. In this work, we learn this mapping
    using physics-informed machine learning methods, namely physics informed neural
    networks and Fourier neural operators. We demonstrate the capabilities of these
    two methods on a dataset of one-dimensional atomic and molecular models. The capabilities
    of each approach are discussed in conjunction with this proof-of-concept presentation.
    The primary finding of our investigation is that the combination of both approaches
    has the greatest potential for inverting the Kohn--Sham equations at scale.

  description: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method
    to investigate electron dynamics under various external perturbations such as
    laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time
    TDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators
    as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints
    and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational
    speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules. This method has
    potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules
    and materials with varying experimental parameters.

  description: Despite the importance of magnetism in numerous materials, magnetic
    effects have been absent in molecular-dynamics studies. Herein, we implement a
    molecular-spin dynamics methodology to accurately resolve, across large regions
    of phase-space, structural/magnetic transitions, and elastic/transport properties
    for iron. This endeavor is critically important for reconciling different theories
    of geodynamo operation, augmenting decades of deep experimental investigation.
    Our approach offers an explicit and scalable treatment for longitudinal spin fluctuations,
    which play a more pronounced role in BCC-iron, a phase hypothesized to exist near
    the melt transition at Earth-core pressures. Leveraging first-principal calculations
    to build an Fe molecular-spin dynamics model, we resolve the high-pressure BCC
    metastability (\>240 GPa), while accurately recovering compressional wave-velocity,
    bulk moduli, viscosity, and electrical conductivity. Dynamic compression of iron
    to Earth-core conditions is one of the few ways to gather important elastic and
    transport properties needed to uncover key mechanisms surrounding the geodynamo
    effect. Herein, a machine-learned ab initio derived molecular-spin dynamics (MSD)
    methodology with explicit treatment for longitudinal spin-fluctuations is utilized
    to probe the dynamic phase-diagram of iron. This framework uniquely enables an
    accurate resolution of the phase-transition kinetics and Earth-core elastic properties,
    as highlighted by compressional wave velocity and adiabatic bulk moduli measurements.
    In addition, a unique coupling of MSD with time-dependent density functional theory
    enables gauging electronic transport properties, critically important for resolving
    geodynamo dynamics.

  description: We report on results from an experiment at the European x-ray free
    electron laser where we measured the x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectrum
    of single crystal silicon with ultrahigh resolution. Compared to similar previous
    experiments, we consider a more complex scattering setup, in which the scattering
    vector changes orientation through the crystal lattice. In doing so, we are able
    to observe strong geometric dependencies in the inelastic scattering spectrum
    of silicon at low scattering angles. Furthermore, the high quality of the experimental
    data allows us to benchmark state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations, and demonstrate
    TDDFT's ability to accurately predict these geometric dependencies. Finally, we
    note that this experimental data was collected at a much faster rate than another
    recently reported dataset using the same setup, demonstrating that ultrahigh resolution
    XRTS data can be collected in more general experimental scenarios.

    of problem: Predicting material properties at experimentally relevant scales remains
    a significant challenge in advanced materials research. Traditional electronic
    structure methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), while widely
    used, are limited by their steep computational demands. DFT calculations typically
    scale cubically with system size, restricting them to simulations of only a few
    thousand atoms. Consequently, large-scale simulations often require approximations,
    classical models, or machine learning methods. Yet, current machine learning approaches
    fall short in replicating the full predictive accuracy of DFT, thereby constraining
    their broader applicability in materials science. Solution method: The Materials
    Learning Algorithms (MALA) software package [1] provides a scalable and efficient
    machine learning framework designed to accelerate electronic structure calculations.
    MALA replaces direct DFT calculations with machine learning models, enabling simulations
    at unprecedented scales. By employing a universal electronic structure representation,
    MALA models recover key observables from which a broad range of material properties
    can be derived. The package provides a unified library that integrates data sampling,
    model training, and scalable inference, while offering seamless compatibility
    with state-of-the-art simulation tools such as Quantum ESPRESSO [2] and LAMMPS
    [3]. This makes MALA a versatile solution for diverse computational materials
    research needs. References [1] A. Cangi et al., MALA (Version 1.3.0) [Computer
