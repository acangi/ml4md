	annote = {Due to its balance of accuracy and computational cost, density functional theory has become the method of choice for computing the electronic structure and related properties of materials. However, present-day semilocal approximations to the exchange-correlation energy of density functional theory break down for materials containing d and f electrons. In this report we summarize our progress in addressing this issue. We describe the construction of the BSC exchange-correlation functional within the subsystem functional formalism which enables us to capture bulk, surface, and confinement physics with a single exchange-correlation functional. We report on the initial assessment of this functional within the jellium surface system and demonstrate that the BSC functional captures the confinement physics more accurately than standard semilocal exchange-correlation functionals. We conclude by outlining our future research objectives which focus on refining the functional form of the BSC functional and achieving significantly more accurate energetics of materials containing f and d electrons than existing semilocal functionals.},

However, present-day semi-local approximations to the exchange-correlation energy of density functional theory break down for materials containing d and f electrons. In this report we summarize the results of our research efforts within the LDRD 200202 titled "Making density functional theory work for all materials" in addressing this issue. Our efforts are grouped into two research thrusts. In the first thrust, we develop an exchange-correlation functional (BSC functional) within the subsystem functional formalism. It enables us to capture bulk, surface, and confinement physics with a single, semi-local exchange-correlation functional in density functional theory calculations. We present the analytical properties of the BSC functional and demonstrate that the BSC functional is able to capture confinement physics more accurately than standard semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. The second research thrust focusses on developing a database for transition metal binary compounds. The database consists of materials properties (formation energies, ground-state energies, lattice constants, and elastic constants) of 26 transition metal elements and 89 transition metal alloys. It serves as a reference for benchmarking computational models (such as lower-level modeling methods and exchange-correlation functionals). We expect that our database will significantly impact the materials science community. We conclude with a brief discussion on the future research directions and impact of our results.},

@techreport{MoStSwTh22,
	annote = {The focus of this project is to accelerate and transform the workflow of multiscale materials modeling by developing an integrated toolchain seamlessly combining DFT, SNAP, LAMMPS, (shown in Figure 1-1) and a machine-learning (ML) model that will more efficiently extract information from a smaller set of first-principles calculations. Our ML model enables us to accelerate first-principles data generation by interpolating existing high fidelity data, and extend the simulation scale by extrapolating high fidelity data (102 atoms) to the mesoscale (104 atoms). It encodes the underlying physics of atomic interactions on the microscopic scale by adapting a variety of ML techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs), and graph neural networks (GNNs). We developed a new surrogate model for density functional theory using deep neural networks. The developed ML surrogate is demonstrated in a workflow to generate accurate band energies, total energies, and density of the 298K and 933K Aluminum systems. Furthermore, the models can be used to predict the quantities of interest for systems with more number of atoms than the training data set. We have demonstrated that the ML model can be used to compute the quantities of interest for systems with 100,000 Al atoms. When compared with 2000 Al system the new surrogate model is as accurate as DFT, but three orders of magnitude faster. We also explored optimal experimental design techniques to choose the training data and novel Graph Neural Networks to train on smaller data sets. These are promising methods that need to be explored in the future.},

@techreport{HaBaGoHe22,
	annote = {Predictive design of REHEDS experiments with radiation-hydrodynamic simulations requires knowledge of material properties (e.g. equations of state (EOS), transport coefficients, and radiation physics). Interpreting experimental results requires accurate models of diagnostic observables (e.g. detailed emission, absorption, and scattering spectra). In conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), these material properties and observables can be pre-computed with relatively high accuracy and subsequently tabulated on simple temperature-density grids for fast look-up by simulations. When radiation and electron temperatures fall out of equilibrium, however, non-LTE effects can profoundly change material properties and diagnostic signatures. Accurately and efficiently incorporating these non-LTE effects has been a longstanding challenge for simulations. At present, most simulations include non-LTE effects by invoking highly simplified inline models. These inline non-LTE models are both much slower than table look-up and significantly less accurate than the detailed models used to populate LTE tables and diagnose experimental data through post-processing or inversion. Because inline non-LTE models are slow, designers avoid them whenever possible, which leads to known inaccuracies from using tabular LTE. Because inline models are simple, they are inconsistent with tabular data from detailed models, leading to ill-known inaccuracies, and they cannot generate detailed synthetic diagnostics suitable for direct comparisons with experimental data. This project addresses the challenge of generating and utilizing efficient, accurate, and consistent non-equilibrium material data along three complementary but relatively independent research lines. First, we have developed a relatively fast and accurate non-LTE average-atom model based on density functional theory (DFT) that provides a complete set of EOS, transport, and radiative data, and have rigorously tested it against more sophisticated first-principles multi-atom DFT models, including time-dependent DFT. Next, we have developed a tabular scheme and interpolation methods that compactly capture non-LTE effects for use in simulations and have implemented these tables in the GORGON magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) code. Finally, we have developed post-processing tools that use detailed tabulated non-LTE data to directly predict experimental observables from simulation output.},

@techreport{NiCaTrRo22,
	annote = {Fully characterizing high energy density (HED) phenomena using pulsed power facilities (Z machine) and coherent light sources is possible only with complementary numerical modeling for design, diagnostic development, and data interpretation. The exercise of creating numerical tests, that match experimental conditions, builds critical insight that is crucial for the development of a strong fundamental understanding of the physics behind HED phenomena and for the design of next generation pulsed power facilities. The persistence of electron correlation in HED materials arising from Coulomb interactions and the Pauli exclusion principle is one of the greatest challenges for accurate numerical modeling and has hitherto impeded our ability to model HED phenomena across multiple length and time scales at sufficient accuracy. An exemplar is a ferromagnetic material like iron, while familiar and widely used, we lack a simulation capability to characterize the interplay of structure and magnetic effects that govern material strength, kinetics of phase transitions and other transport properties. Herein we construct and demonstrate the Molecular-Spin Dynamics (MSD) simulation capability for iron from ambient to earth core conditions, all software advances are open source and presently available for broad usage. These methods are multi-scale in nature, direct comparisons between high fidelity density functional theory (DFT) and linear-scaling MSD simulations is done throughout this work, with advancements made to MSD allowing for electronic structure changes being reflected in classical dynamics. Main takeaways for the project include insight into the role of magnetic spins on mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, development of accurate interatomic potentials paired with spin Hamiltonians, and characterization of the high pressure melt boundary that is of critical importance to planetary modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Computational tools to study thermodynamic properties of magnetic materials have, until recently, been limited to phenomenological modeling or to small domain sizes limiting our mechanistic understanding of thermal transport in ferromagnets. Herein, we study the interplay of phonon and magnetic spin contributions to the thermal conductivity in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha{\$}{\$}-iron utilizing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It was observed that the magnetic spin contribution to the total thermal conductivity exceeds lattice transport for temperatures up to two-thirds of the Curie temperature after which only strongly coupled magnon-phonon modes become active heat carriers. Characterizations of the phonon and magnon spectra give a detailed insight into the coupling between these heat carriers, and the temperature sensitivity of these coupled systems. Comparisons to both experiments and ab initio data support our inferred electronic thermal conductivity, supporting the coupled molecular dynamics/spin dynamics framework as a viable method to extend the predictive capability for magnetic material properties.},

@article{KoSaBhBh23,
	abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification systems are often susceptible to noise interruption, i.e., minor image noise may significantly impact the outcome. On the contrary, classical Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is known for handling noisy data due to the stochastic and temporal behaviour of the spiking neuron signals. However, it is not always feasible to train the weights of the classical SNN due to stochastic and non-differentiable spiking signals. Recent applications of quantum machine learning to stochastic modelling have predicted that quantum computing would prove to be a significant advantage, hence catapulting the study of quantum and neuromorphic computing to a new level of development. Motivated by these observations, this paper introduces a shallow hybrid classical--quantum spiking feedforward neural network referred to as Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN) for dealing with a robust image classification task in the presence of noise and adversarial attacks. The proposed SQNN offers the inherent capabilities of processing unforeseen noisy test images due to its spatial and temporal information. An efficient variational quantum circuit training with the help of a standard back-propagation algorithm obviates the classical Spiking Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike-Prop algorithms, which are often found inefficient in training the feedforward SNN. The proposed SQNN is extensively tested and benchmarked on the PennyLane Quantum Simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed SQNN model supersedes the feedforward SNN (SFNN), Random Quantum Neural Networks (RQNN), AlexNet and ResNet-18 on unseen test images with added noise from the FashionMNIST, MNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive investigation of the electrical and thermal conductivity of iron under high pressures at ambient temperature, employing the real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT). Specifically, we examine the influence of a Hubbard correction (+U) to account for strong electron correlations. Our calculations based on RT-TDDFT demonstrate that the evaluated electrical conductivity for both high-pressure body-centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) iron phases agrees well with experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the anisotropy in the thermal conductivity of HCP iron under high pressure, and our findings are consistent with experimental observations. Interestingly, we find that the incorporation of the +U correction significantly impacts the ground state and linear response properties of iron at pressures below 50 GPa, with its influence diminishing as pressure increases. This study offers valuable insights into the influence of electronic correlations on the electronic transport properties of iron under extreme conditions.},

In this study, we develop neural network models for predicting the EOS based on first-principles data. The first model utilises basic physical properties, while the second model incorporates more sophisticated physical information, using output from average-atom (AA) calculations as features. AA models are often noted for providing a reasonable balance of accuracy and speed; however, our comparison of AA models and higher-fidelity calculations shows that more accurate models are required in the WDM regime. Both the neural network models we propose, particularly the physics-enhanced one, demonstrate significant potential as accurate and efficient methods for computing EOS data in WDM.},

	abstract = {Electronic structure theory calculations offer an understanding of matter at the quantum level, complementing experimental studies in materials science and chemistry. One of the most widely used methods, density functional theory, maps a set of real interacting electrons to a set of fictitious non-interacting electrons that share the same probability density. Ensuring that the density remains the same depends on the exchange-correlation (XC) energy and, by a derivative, the XC potential. Inversions provide a method to obtain exact XC potentials from target electronic densities, in hopes of gaining insights into accuracy-boosting approximations. Neural networks provide a new avenue to perform inversions by learning the mapping from density to potential. In this work, we learn this mapping using physics-informed machine learning methods, namely physics informed neural networks and Fourier neural operators. We demonstrate the capabilities of these two methods on a dataset of one-dimensional atomic and molecular models. The capabilities of each approach are discussed in conjunction with this proof-of-concept presentation. The primary finding of our investigation is that the combination of both approaches has the greatest potential for inverting the Kohn--Sham equations at scale.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of magnetism in numerous materials, magnetic effects have been absent in molecular-dynamics studies. Herein, we implement a molecular-spin dynamics methodology to accurately resolve, across large regions of phase-space, structural/magnetic transitions, and elastic/transport properties for iron. This endeavor is critically important for reconciling different theories of geodynamo operation, augmenting decades of deep experimental investigation. Our approach offers an explicit and scalable treatment for longitudinal spin fluctuations, which play a more pronounced role in BCC-iron, a phase hypothesized to exist near the melt transition at Earth-core pressures. Leveraging first-principal calculations to build an Fe molecular-spin dynamics model, we resolve the high-pressure BCC metastability (\>240 GPa), while accurately recovering compressional wave-velocity, bulk moduli, viscosity, and electrical conductivity. Dynamic compression of iron to Earth-core conditions is one of the few ways to gather important elastic and transport properties needed to uncover key mechanisms surrounding the geodynamo effect. Herein, a machine-learned ab initio derived molecular-spin dynamics (MSD) methodology with explicit treatment for longitudinal spin-fluctuations is utilized to probe the dynamic phase-diagram of iron. This framework uniquely enables an accurate resolution of the phase-transition kinetics and Earth-core elastic properties, as highlighted by compressional wave velocity and adiabatic bulk moduli measurements. In addition, a unique coupling of MSD with time-dependent density functional theory enables gauging electronic transport properties, critically important for resolving geodynamo dynamics.},

	abstract = {We report on results from an experiment at the European x-ray free electron laser where we measured the x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectrum of single crystal silicon with ultrahigh resolution. Compared to similar previous experiments, we consider a more complex scattering setup, in which the scattering vector changes orientation through the crystal lattice. In doing so, we are able to observe strong geometric dependencies in the inelastic scattering spectrum of silicon at low scattering angles. Furthermore, the high quality of the experimental data allows us to benchmark state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations, and demonstrate TDDFT's ability to accurately predict these geometric dependencies. Finally, we note that this experimental data was collected at a much faster rate than another recently reported dataset using the same setup, demonstrating that ultrahigh resolution XRTS data can be collected in more general experimental scenarios.},

@article{CaFiBrSh25,
	abstract = {We present the Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) package, a scalable machine learning framework designed to accelerate density functional theory (DFT) calculations suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. Using local descriptors of the atomic environment, MALA models efficiently predict key electronic observables, including local density of states, electronic density, density of states, and total energy. The package integrates data sampling, model training and scalable inference into a unified library, while ensuring compatibility with standard DFT and molecular dynamics codes. We demonstrate MALA's capabilities with examples including boron clusters, aluminum across its solid-liquid phase boundary, and predicting the electronic structure of a stacking fault in a large beryllium slab. Scaling analyses reveal MALA's computational efficiency and identify bottlenecks for future optimization. With its ability to model electronic structures at scales far beyond standard DFT, MALA is well suited for modeling complex material systems, making it a versatile tool for advanced materials research. Program summary Program Title: Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/vbrxhnrvf2.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/mala-project/mala Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause Programming language: Python, Fortran Nature of problem: Predicting material properties at experimentally relevant scales remains a significant challenge in advanced materials research. Traditional electronic structure methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), while widely used, are limited by their steep computational demands. DFT calculations typically scale cubically with system size, restricting them to simulations of only a few thousand atoms. Consequently, large-scale simulations often require approximations, classical models, or machine learning methods. Yet, current machine learning approaches fall short in replicating the full predictive accuracy of DFT, thereby constraining their broader applicability in materials science. Solution method: The Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) software package [1] provides a scalable and efficient machine learning framework designed to accelerate electronic structure calculations. MALA replaces direct DFT calculations with machine learning models, enabling simulations at unprecedented scales. By employing a universal electronic structure representation, MALA models recover key observables from which a broad range of material properties can be derived. The package provides a unified library that integrates data sampling, model training, and scalable inference, while offering seamless compatibility with state-of-the-art simulation tools such as Quantum ESPRESSO [2] and LAMMPS [3]. This makes MALA a versatile solution for diverse computational materials research needs. References [1] A.
